    <h3>What went well on my project?</h3>
    <p>I was able to make the animation smoothly. It was pretty easy to put it in github.</p>
    <h3>What were my challenges?</h3>
    <p>Making the layout was hard because it has to look different on different size screens.</p>
    <h3>What did I learn making this website?</h3>
    <p>The first step was to make a website with no stylesheets.I learned how to make html tags. <br>The second step was making a page 2 with stylesheets. I learned about css. <br>The third step was to make the images for my site. I learned how to crop and re-size pictures in <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">inkscape</a>. In inkscape we used overlay to make pictures darker.  <br>For the fourth step I used <a href="https://www.gimp.org">gimp</a> to make an animation. First I made a background. Each change in the robot is a different layer. Finally I did a animation filter in gimp to make a animated gif file.  <br>The 5th step was to make the layout change when screen is under 600 px wide.  I did this with media queries.  This means the computer asks how big the screen is and chooses the layout based on that. I also used overflow when the height was too small.<br>The very last step was to put it on the internet. I used <a href="https://github.com">github</a> for this.</p>
    <h3>For next time ... </h3>
    <p>I would use javascript because it's more interactive.</p>
