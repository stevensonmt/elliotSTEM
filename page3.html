    <h2>How I made this website</h2>
    <p>The first step was to make a website with no stylesheets.I learned how to make html tags.</p>
    <p> The second step was making a page 2 with stylesheets. I learned about css.</p>
    <p> The third step was to make the images for my site. I learned how to crop and re-size pictures in <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">inkscape</a>. In inkscape we used overlay to make pictures darker.</p>
    <p>For the fourth step I used <a href="https://www.gimp.org">gimp</a> to make an animation. First I made a background. Each change in the robot is a different layer. Finally I did a animation filter in gimp to make a animated gif file.</p>
    <p> The very last step was to put it on the internet. I used <a href="https://github.com">github</a> for this.</p>
